# GitHub Pages Setup

Use this public site for Amazon Associates:

```text
https://budgetpilotllc.github.io/grocery-shopping-assistant/
```

That URL assumes:

- GitHub account or organization: `BudgetPilotLLC`
- Repository name: `grocery-shopping-assistant`
- GitHub Pages source folder: `/docs`

## Create the Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new while signed in as `BudgetPilotLLC`.
2. Repository name: `grocery-shopping-assistant`
3. Visibility: Public
4. Create the repository.

## Upload This Project

If Git is installed:

```powershell
git init
git branch -M main
git add .
git commit -m "Add grocery shopping assistant landing page"
git remote add origin https://github.com/BudgetPilotLLC/grocery-shopping-assistant.git
git push -u origin main
```

If Git is not installed, use GitHub's web upload:

1. Open the new repository.
2. Choose Add file > Upload files.
3. Upload this project folder's files.
4. Commit to `main`.

## Enable GitHub Pages

1. Open the repository on GitHub.
2. Go to Settings > Pages.
3. Source: Deploy from a branch.
4. Branch: `main`
5. Folder: `/docs`
6. Save.

GitHub usually publishes the page within a minute or two.

## Amazon Associates Field

On the Amazon Associates "Website and Mobile App List" screen, put this in **Enter Your Website(s)**:

```text
https://budgetpilotllc.github.io/grocery-shopping-assistant/
```

Leave the mobile app field empty until the mobile app is published in an app store.
